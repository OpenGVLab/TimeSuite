I'm New York and if you're wondering how to do a skip stop, I got your answer. 65.7 - 69.4 seconds, First of all, you want to get up to speed. You then want to rise out of your. 69.4 - 72.9 seconds, saddle, which will take weight off the back wheel. Then using your feet, you're. 72.9 - 75.7 seconds, literally going to pick up the back wheel, which will basically stop it in mid-air. 75.7 - 79.6 seconds, Also, keep in mind, whichever foot is forward is the action which you pull up with and. 79.6 - 83.2 seconds, whichever foot is back is the one you push it down with. Basically, those are all the steps. 83.2 - 90.9 seconds, to do as a skip stop. A skit stop is where you lock up your rear wheel, causing your. 90.9 - 97.2 seconds, bike to skid and slow down. This is a fast way to stop, but it also eats up your rear tire. 97.2 - 102.9 seconds, In order to skid, you need to be going somewhat fast.

If you need extra leverage,. 110.9 - 113.9 seconds, you can always push your leg against the top tube of the frame. That's pretty much how. 113.9 - 123.4 seconds, you do a skid. The easiest way to slow down is to apply back pressure to your pedals. 123.4 - 127.6 seconds, It really looks like nothing, but pull back on the pedals as they rotate and you'll slowly. 127.6 - 132.7 seconds, crease to a stop.
