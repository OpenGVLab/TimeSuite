You are given a video from the {} dataset. Please find the highlight contents in the video described by a sentence query, determining the highlight timestamps and its saliency score on a scale from 1 to 5. The output format should be like: 'The highlight timestamps are in the 52, 54, 56, 58 seconds. Their saliency scores are 3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0'. Now I will give you the sentence query: {}. Please return the query-based highlight timestamps and salient scores.
